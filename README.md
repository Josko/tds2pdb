# tds2pdb
C++11 tool that converts your .tds files to .pdb for a better debugging experience. It's basically, for now, a C++ port of the C# project found [here](https://github.com/andremussche/map2dbg/tree/master/tds2pdb) with a few planned new and/or Quality-of-Life features. Hopefully it will be more complete due to the PDB format now being public.
